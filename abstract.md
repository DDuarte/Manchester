Customers interact with e-commerce websites in multiple ways and the companies
operating them rely on optimizing success metrics such as CTR (Click
through Rate), CPC (Cost per Conversion), Basket and Lifetime Value and User
Engagement for profit. Changing what, how and when content such as product
recommendations and ads are displayed can influence customers’ actions.

Multiple algorithms and techniques in data mining and machine learning
have been applied in this context. Summarizing and analyzing user behaviour
can be expensive and tricky since it’s hard to extrapolate patterns that never
occurred before and the causality aspects of the system are not usually taken
into consideration. Commonly used online techniques such as A/B testing and
multi-armed bandit optimization have the down side of having a high operational
cost (including time e.g if a data scientist is evaluating the impact of a new
recommendation engine after one month, she would need to wait an actual
month to have results). However, there has been studies about characterizing
user behaviour and interactions in e-commerce websites that could be used to
improve this process.

The goal of this dissertation is to create a framework capable of running a
multi-agent simulation, by regarding users in an e-commerce website and react
to stimuli that influence their actions. Furthermore, some statistical constructs
such as Baysian networks, Markov chains or probability distributions can be
used to guide how these agents interact with the system. By taking input from
web mining (Web structure mining (WSM), Web usage mining (WUM) and
Web content mining (WCM)), which includes both static and dynamic content
of websites as well as user personas, the simulation should collect success metrics
so that the experimentation being run can be evaluated. For example, this
framework could be used to try different approaches to product recommendation
and estimate the impact of it.
