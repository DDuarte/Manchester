Customers interact with e-commerce websites in multiple ways and the companies
operating them rely on optimizing success metrics such as CTR (Click
through Rate), CPC (Cost per Conversion), Basket and Lifetime Value and User
Engagement for profit. Changing what, how and when content such as product
recommendations and ads are displayed can influence customers’ actions.

Multiple algorithms and techniques in data mining and machine learning
have been applied in this context.

\section{Motivation and Goals} \label{sec:goals}

Summarizing and analyzing user behaviour can be expensive and tricky since it’s 
hard to extrapolate patterns that never occurred before and the causality 
aspects of the system are not usually taken into consideration. Commonly used 
online techniques such as A/B testing and multi-armed bandit optimization have 
the down side of having a high operational cost (including time e.g if a data 
scientist is evaluating the impact of a new recommendation engine after one 
month, she would need to wait an actual month to have results). However, there 
has been studies about characterizing user behaviour and interactions in 
e-commerce websites that could be used to improve this process.

The goal of this dissertation is to create a framework capable of running a
multi-agent simulation, by regarding users in an e-commerce website and react
to stimuli that influence their actions. Furthermore, some statistical 
constructs such as Baysian networks, Markov chains or probability distributions 
can be used to guide how these agents interact with the system. By taking input 
from web mining (Web structure mining (WSM), Web usage mining (WUM) and
Web content mining (WCM)), which includes both static and dynamic content
of websites as well as user personas, the simulation should collect success 
metrics so that the experimentation being run can be evaluated. For example, 
this framework could be used to try different approaches to product 
recommendation and estimate the impact of it.

\section{Report Structure} \label{sec:struct}

Besides this introduction, this report has 5 more chapters.

In chapters \ref{chap:ecommerce}, \ref{chap:simulation} and \ref{chap:models}, 
we describe the literature review and state of the art in regard to e-commerce, 
simulation systems and probabilistic models, respectively. The chapter 
\ref{chap:ecommerce} focuses on e-commerce background, what metrics can be used 
on e-commerce websites and the customer life cycle, an important part in the 
simulation. The chapter \ref{chap:simulation} describes three main topics 
regarding simulating systems: agent based, discrete event simulation and 
systems dynamics. Finally, the chapter \ref{chap:models} deals with describing 
some probabilistic models, with emphasis on graphical models and Bayesian 
statistics.

Chapter \ref{chap:method} is concerned with describing the problem at hand in 
detail and the methodology that will be used for the dissertation.

The final chapter, chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}, concludes the work realized, 
describes a SWOT\footnote{Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats} 
analysis applied to the project and proposes a work plan for the dissertation.
