\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{chap:conclusion}

\section*{}

This chapter concludes the work realized for the dissertation planning. It 
presents the conclusions including a SWOT analysis.

\section{Overview}

The state of the art literature review focused on three main areas, e-commerce, 
simulation and probabilistic models. There was an attempt at showing the 
classic techniques and approaches but also in showing extensions and 
improvements to those.

In order to better assess the work required for the dissertation, a SWOT 
analysis is in order.

% \subsection{SWOT Analysis}
% 
% Regarding strengths, there is a wide and vast research in the area of 
% simulation and modelling. There is also a strong confidence that the methods, 
% approaches and techniques reviewed in the state of the art can be used to 
%model 
% user browsing behaviour successfully.
% 
% Concerning weaknesses, the proposed framework relates too many different 
%areas, 
% which may make the dissertation too broad in scope, making it hard to focus 
%on 
% something specific (``do one thing and do it well''\footnote{Unix 
%philosophy}).
% 
% In regards to opportunities, no other similar framework or tool was found, 
% which means that the work being done might be novel and may provide extra 
%value 
% to third parties (e.g the scientific community as tool to validate and test 
% others models like recommendation systems or to companies focusing on 
% e-commerce).
% 
% Regarding threats, testing and validating the framework may be problematic, 
%in 
% terms of corroborating results with real data or even finding a suitable 
% approach to validation itself.
